  * milestone weights will vary
* Weekly Progress: Instructor Checkins + Written Logs — 25%
* Github pull requests and commits
* Project difficulty
* Individual contribution scaling vs Team grade

???
* may be adjusted slightly
* your grade my vary based on individual contribution (combined metric of time+feedback+participation+github)
* logs are like hour logs for  billing at a company - slightly annoying but keeps everybody on target - will be pretty easy

* will discuss per project later


???
* some data persistance or computation
* some display of said data or computation that is reasonably complex

name: Problems to Solve

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/c5eqVJN7oNLTq" width="380" height="272" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

* Considerations
  * Novelty: explore something new(ish)
  * Impact: bigger than here
  * Format: game, web, mobile, iot, wearable, etc

???
* some of you have ideas, don't worry but take a step back and do some more ideating
* Think outside of what is useful to Dartmouth students
* startup advice is wrong - don't always have to solve a problem you yourself face
* new event apps, social network clones, and marketplaces have been attempted before and you might find it more rewarding to build something that challenges you.
* sometimes can't be solved - event planning for instance - just needs everybody to use the same platform
