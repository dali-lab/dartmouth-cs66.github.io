## Textbook ##

A collection of online resources will be used, but no textbook will be required.  Current blog posts and videos about the state of various technologies and best practices will be included in some assignments.  Peruse them to learn something. If you have good resources that you find along the way - [contribute](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52/dartmouth-cs52.github.io/issues)!

## Auditing ##

Unfortunately due to the nature of the class and our classroom size, auditing the class will not be permitted. All class material will be posted here online though! If are following along and need help you are welcome to come to [DALI Open Lab Hours](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/dali-open-lab-nights/).

## Slack ##

We will use [Slack](https://cs66-dartmouth.slack.com), an online collaborative tool for most class messaging and help. Details in class. We will also write slack integrations!

## Grading ##

Grading of some collaborative team based work will be done based on GitHub pull requests.  Proper git flow will be introduced early on in the term. Using version control will become second nature to you.

  - In-class short assignments: 10%
  - 5 week-long labs:  25%
  - Short In-class quizzes:  10%
  - 1 group presentation and workshop: 10%
  - group workshop participation:  10%
  - 1 final project:  30%
  - class participation:  5%

  * late penalty:
    * -1% of assignment per hour
    * 2 allowed re-submits (capped at 80%)


## Software ##

We will use open source development tools and frameworks.  Note: These will work out of the box in macOS and Linux, and should work ok with a bit of coercion in Windows (tested in Win10).  (details in short assignment 1)

## Honor principle -- Not your standard warning! ##

The web is an open place and there is a lot of code out there.  We want you to be able to show your work and to be proud of the code you have written.  To this end, all your work will be on GitHub.  However, you do need to learn and as such all the code for the labs and for your portion of the final project will need to actually be written by you.

### The Internet

The Internet will be a large source of information and help to you as you do your assignments in this class.  We want to encourage you to scour the internet / [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for help, **but** you **must credit** any solutions you find in comments in your code specifying where you found them and what you took from them.  If you copy/paste code without attribution you are violating the Academic Honor Principle, and we hope you enjoy your 3 term vacation.  You will **not** be penalized for copied code as long as it is **properly attributed** and some significant portion of your project was still written by you. Obviously don't copy/paste the whole project.

### Student Collaboration

For the short assignments and the labs you may verbally collaborate as much as you want. However, the code that you commit (turn in), should be created, typed, documented, and output generated, by you. You may consult freely with instructors and classmates but you should work individually when actually coding. You should never copy code from other students or from previous students of the class. Your peers are not considered an authorized source. Even looking at another student's code for "inspiration" or "debugging" is not allowed.  Discuss as much as you want, but do not copy. To do otherwise is a violation of the Academic Honor Principle. Any collaboration with another student should be documented in the comments.  Again no penalty for mentioning that you talked to somebody, but if you did talk to someone and your code is very similar to theirs this will raise questions, better to clarify upfront. If you do end up looking at another student's code, CITE IT.

### Honor Code Violation Examples

These are designed to serve to help illustrate the various situations that might arise and whether they are or are not violations of the Academic Honor Code.  Violations will be reported to the Committee on Standards. Regardless of the outcome of the COS hearing, we reserve the right to assign a failing grade on an assignment were we suspect an honor code violation occurred.

1. You find a block of code online that you don't quite understand but it seems to work either when you make your code look similar or you copy/paste it in. Either because you are embarrassed or careless you do not cite where you got the code from.  This is a violation of the Honor Code.  CITE IT and you will be fine.
1. It is midnight and the assignment is due and your friend sends you a block of code to help debug.  You try to not look at it, but you end up turning in something very similar to what your friend sent. This is an Honor Code Violation for both you and your friend! Your friend and you will both have to face a COS hearing.  This is an attribution error. CITE IT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.  If you had turned it in with an attribution: "I whole-heartedly copied this from my friend N",  we would deduct points from your assignment, but that is it!
1. You and a couple of friends are working together on an individual (not team) assignment. You are talking about it and planning it out on the whiteboard.  If you are using natural spoken language you are ok.  If you are writing code on the board, or telling each other what to type in, that is a violation of the Honor Code.  You will all end up with the same code and will face a COS hearing to disentangle what happened.  These hearings are brutal with back-stabbings, tears, and ruined friendships. Why risk it?  When talking about your assignments together, just do it as if you were helping each other learn: ask questions, give hints. That is why we are all here after all.


### Citation Format

Make your in-code citations look something like this:

```
// adapted from: http://stackoverflow.com/someurl
// this method does x and y

or

// copied off of Cameron Howe's code for this assignment
// this method does x and y
```

(policy adapted from: https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code)


### But officer I panicked!

If you are stuck: ask for an extension, come to office hours, email or slack your Professor and your TAs, learn some humility and accept that you might need help. Asking for help is one of the greatest skills that one can possess, and if you get anything from this class is that it is OK to ask for help.  

Please do not create a horrible situation for all of us by just copying off of someone else.  Our job is to help you learn.  You will not be penalized for asking.

## Special accommodations and Religious observances##

Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible.  Similarly for Religious observances please talk to the staff as early as possible to resolve any conflicts.
