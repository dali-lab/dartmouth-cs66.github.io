## Textbook ##

Textbook: A collection of online resources will be used, but no textbook will be required, suggested reading [*A​rt of Game Design: A Book of Lenses​*](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Game-Design-Lenses-Second/dp/1466598646/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JAEV1FGJ55BAFGS9X9DW) and [*G​ame Programming Patterns​*](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/). Current blog posts and videos about the state of various technologies and best practices will be included in some assignments.

## Auditing ##

Unfortunately due to the nature of the class, auditing the class will not be permitted. All class material will be posted online, however.

## Slack ##

We will use [Slack](https://cs66-dartmouth.slack.com), an online collaborative tool for most class messaging and help. Details in class.

## Grading ##

Grading of some collaborative team-based work will be done based on GitHub pull requests. Proper git flow will be introduced early on in the term. Using version control will become second nature to you.

* In-class short assignments: 10%
* 5 week-long labs: 25%
* Short In-class quizzes: 10%
* 1 group presentation and workshop: 10%
* group workshop participation: 10%
* 1 final project: 30%
* class participation: 5%

* late penalty:
  * -1% of assignment per hour
  * 2 allowed re-submits (capped at 80%)
  * 1x free 24-hour extension (no advance notice necessary)

## Software ##

We will primarily use Unity3D along with some open source development tools and frameworks. Windows/Mac are supported.

## Honor principle -- Not your standard warning! ##

Unity3D is a driver in democratizing game development. As such, there is a lot of code available on the Internet. We want you to be able to show your work and to be proud of the code you have written. To this end, all your work will be on GitHub. However, you do need to learn and all the code for the labs and for your portion of the final project will need to actually be written by you.

### The Internet

The Internet will be a large source of information and help you as you do your assignments in this class. We want to encourage you to scour the internet / [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for help, but you must credit any solutions you find in comments in your code specifying where you found them and what you took from them. If you copy/paste code without attribution you are violating the Academic Honor Principle. You will not be penalized for copied code as long as it is properly attributed and some significant portion of your project was still written by you. Obviously, do not copy/paste the whole project.


### Student Collaboration

For the short assignments and the labs, you may verbally collaborate as much as you want. However, the code that you commit (turn in), should be created, typed, documented and output generated, by you. You may consult freely with instructors and classmates but you should work individually when actually coding. If you copy or look at code from another current or previous student for “debugging” purposes, it will be considered a violation of the Academic Honor Principle unless you cite that you have done so in the code. All collaboration with another student should be documented in the comments and cited, exactly as you would with an internet resource. If there is any question about whether you wrote the code yourself or were inspired by or copied off of others, just C​ITE IT​. You may lose some points for not implementing that specific component yourself, but properly cited code will not be considered a violation of the Academic Honor Principle.

### Citation Format

Make your in-code citations look something like this (policy adapted from: https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code):

```
// adapted from: http://stackoverflow.com/someurl
// this method does x and y

or

// copied off of Cameron Howe's code for this assignment
// this method does x and y
```


### Honor Code Violation Examples

These are designed to serve to help illustrate the various situations that might arise and whether they are or are not violations of the Academic Honor Code. Violations will be reported to the Committee on Standards. Regardless of the outcome of the COS hearing, we reserve the right to assign a failing grade on an assignment were we suspect an honor code violation occurred.

1. You find a block of code online that you don’t quite understand but it seems to work either when you make your code look similar or you copy/paste it in. Either because you are embarrassed or careless you do not cite where you got the code from. This is a violation of the Honor Code. CITE IT and you will be fine.
1. It is midnight and the assignment is due and your friend sends you a block of code to help debug. You try to not look at it, but you end up turning in something very similar to what your friend sent. This would be attribution error and an Academic Honor Code violation i​ f you did not cite it.​ CITE IT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. If you had turned it in with an attribution: “I whole-heartedly copied this from my friend N”, we would deduct points from your assignment, but that is it!
1. You and a couple of friends are working together on an individual (not team) assignment. You are talking about it and planning it out on the whiteboard. If you are using natural spoken language you are ok. If you are writing code on the board or telling each other what to type in, that is a violation of the Academic Honor Code ​if you do not cite it​. If you have not properly attributed work to your friend and you end up with the same code you would face a COS hearing to disentangle what happened. These hearings are brutal with back-stabbings, tears, and ruined friendships. Why risk it? The best approach when talking about your assignments together is to do it as if you were helping each other learn: ask questions, give hints. That is why we are all here after all. If you type in what someone tells you to type, CITE IT.



### But officer I panicked!

If you are stuck: ask for an extension, come to office hours, email or slack your Professor and your TAs, learn some humility and accept that you might need help. Asking for help is one of the greatest skills that one can possess, and if you get anything from this class is that it is OK to ask for help.

Please do not create a horrible situation for all of us by copying code without citing the source. Our job is to help you learn. You will not be penalized for asking.

## Special accommodations

Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to meet with the instructor privately as early in the term as possible. Students requiring disability-related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (205 Collis Student Center, 646-9900, Student.Accessibility.Services@Dartmouth.edu). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent
Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to the instructor. As a first step, if you have questions about whether you qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, you should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.

## Wellness

We recognize that the academic environment at Dartmouth is challenging, that our terms are intensive, and that classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including your ​undergraduate dean​ , ​Counseling and Human Development,​ and the ​Student Wellness Center​. I encourage you to use these resources and come speak with me to take care of yourself throughout the term.

## Religious Observances

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
