# ORC Description
Digital games are a growing platform for education, entertainment, and visualization with a myriad of technological and theoretical challenges. This course explores the concepts and techniques involved in developing real-time 2D and 3D games, as well as the opportunities and constraints when applied to the field of serious games in areas such as education, healthcare, scientific visualization, emergency planning and response, government, and engineering. Topics include: 2d and 3d game engines, game ai, procedural generation, real-time rendering pipelines, game physics, shaders, game programming patterns, networked games, state synchronization, and game mechanics. Projects include building games from scratch such as an online multiplayer game with a server-side component.

# Prerequisite

COSC 10 or permission of [instructor](mailto:tim@cs.dartmouth.edu). 

# Coursework and Grading

* 5 short assignments: 10%
  These will introduce weekly topics and prepare for follow-up longer lab assignments. These are structured as tutorials on mini-games illustrating central concepts and tools.
* 5 week long labs: 25%
  Longer weekly assignments that will each consist of a mini project involving a particular conceptual framework. Some of these will be collaborative.
* 4 Short in-class quizzes: 10%
  Concepts and methods from lectures and labs.
* 1 group presentation and workshop: 10%
  Once during the term (in groups) students will present a short workshop on a game development topic to learn by teaching.
* Group workshop and class participation: 10%
  Individual participation in each of the group presentation workshops. Will require following along with in-class exercises, demonstrations, and tutorials.
* 1 final project: 30%
  A team-based final project starting with pitching an idea and culminating in a fully playable multiplayer game. Assessment will be based on git pull requests and specific technical components that will be required for the projects.
* Participation: 5%
  In class collaborative demonstrations, exercises, and discussions.

# Learning Objectives

üèÑ This class will be an adventure and requires active participation both inside and outside of class.

By the end of this course, you will:

* üîç Understand the underlying concepts required to build digital games from the fields of graphics, ai, programming languages, and networks.
* üó∫ Learn about applying serious game concepts to a variety of real-world situations such as disabilities, child developmental stages, literacy, immigration, health, workplace, or specific educational needs.
* üíª Use your knowledge of the fundamental concepts and best practices of game development to architect educational and serious games from scratch.
* üèóÔ∏èUtilize state-of-the-art tools and frameworks used to build games.
* üî¨Evaluate the opportunities and constraints afforded by the techniques and practices you have learned in solving real-world challenges.
* ‚úèÔ∏èDesign and build your own games-for-change in 2d and 3d spaces and use server-side APIs for complex multiplayer environments.


### Class:

Classes will meet Tuesday and Thursday with half of each class will be hands-on demonstrations, code and project discussions, and exercises.
