Each team should be prepared to demo what they have currently and to discuss their progress. We'll offer bug rewards in the form of snacks! Bugs will need to be submitted in the form of git issues on each others repositories. PR's are extra credit!

## To Turn In:

* github urls to at least 2 issues that you opened on the other projects repo
* any EC pull request urls
