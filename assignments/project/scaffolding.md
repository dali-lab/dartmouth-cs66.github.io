This milestone is all about setting up initial code scaffolding and getting ready to push code!


## Scaffolding

Now that you have your functionality mapped out let's start on planning the coding.  You now have the features all planned out.  How do you want to build it?  Plan out what technology you think you want to use and let's get some code scaffolding ready.   The project does have some minimal technical specs that must be fulfilled, but you are free to use alternative tech stacks as long as the whole team has some experience with them.

### Minimal Architecture:

* API server backend
  * should persist data to a database
  * should have multiple datatypes stored
* Frontend webapp
  * should read/write data from API
  * should have several views
  * should have styling!


In your project's main README.md file (you may have multiple repos, but for now just use the repo you'll be using for the frontend) start to outline the tech stack you will using. As you work on the project your README.md file will be a record of the tools you are using and how to get your dev environment running.

Start this doc now:

```
# Project Name

TODO: short project description, some sample screenshots or mockups

## Architecture

TODO:  descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

## Setup

TODO: how to get the project dev environment up and running, npm install etc

## Deployment

TODO: how to deploy the project

## Authors

TODO: list of authors

## Acknowledgments


```

You don't have to fill in the whole document for this milestone, but do start on it and fill in what you can. You should get some basics of your project up and running. If you are using starter code from the course, pull it into your repo.  Try do to a little layout so that you have a main component and a hello world for the frontend and a hello world from the backend.  If you have an idea of any modules and libraries you are planning on using, document them and or get them installed in your repos.

Note: using github will be an essential part of the final project.  We'd like you to use branches and pull requests as you work on the final project together.  You don't necessarily need to do code reviews, but doing git flow with feature branches will help you organize your team and your code. Additionally doing PR's is required and you will be graded on your github code contributions to your project.

Make sure that your github username and email are set correctly so that we can track your contributions.

```bash
git log
```

will show you recent commits and you should check to make sure your email is one that works and is listed as one of your emails in your github settings: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/

ðŸš€ Make sure each team member has made a github pull request to contribute to this as we want to make sure that at this point everybody is comfortable running the starter code and contributing via git.


## To Turn In:

* Code scaffolding:
  * initial starter code
  * working hello worlds of api server and client
* github:
  * github repos set up with README.md files started
  * at least 1 pull request per team member (documentation counts)
